<h1>How We Talk About Code</h1>
<div>

</div>
</header><p>A while back I had a boss that had very strong opinions about how the team
talked about our code base. His general attitude was roughly this &ldquo;once the code
is in the main branch, it is now <i>our</i> code and no longer <i>my</i> code&rdquo;.
Basically the thought was this; as a team we&rsquo;ve agreed, by review, that we
accept this code and are saying this can go in our shared code base - now making
it <i>our</i> code that we are all responsible for.</p>
<p>In general this is a pretty small thing to note, but I do think the way we talk
about things can have a huge impact on the way we interact with them. When viewing
something as the team&rsquo;s we might all take more care using/improving it. This
shared responsibility also helps around blame - which should really be avoided
in general.. something broke, big deal (and it might be), the why is <i>much</i>
more important than the <i>who</i>.</p>
<p>As a team we should support and help one another as much as possible. I believe
this a very small thing that, overtime, can improve the way we work together and
help improve things through a feeling of shared responsibility.</p>
<p>** I should really due diligence and search around for where this &ldquo;our/my&rdquo; idea
originated. If it was my boss, I&rsquo;ll make sure to give explicit credit.</p>
