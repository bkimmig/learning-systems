<h1>The fight against technical entropy</h1>

</header><p>As an engineering team, your goal is to maintain an appropriate technical quality level while devoting as much energy as possible towards the core business. We must balance quality across multiple time frames, and those time frames generally have conflicting needs.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing most people are likely to agree on, it’s that there’s a crisis of technical quality. One diagnosis and cure is easy to identify: our engineers aren’t prioritizing quality, and we need to hire better engineers or retrain the ones we have. It’s a compelling narrative with a clear villain, and it conveniently shifts blame. Still, like most narratives that move accountability, it’s both unhelpful and wrong.</p>
<p>In most cases, low technical quality isn’t a crisis. It is the expected, normal state. Most engineers generally make reasonable quality decisions when they make them. However, as time moves on and other changes get made, most of your previous technical decisions won’t meet previous quality threshold. This ongoing fight is an essential and what differentiates high performing teams.</p>
<p>There’s a particular joy in drilling into the challenge at hand until you find a generalized problem worth solving. However, an equally important instinct is solving the current situation quickly and moving on to the next pressing issue. As you think about the right improvements, it’s generally most effective to start with the lightest weight solutions and only progress towards massive solutions as earlier efforts collapse under the pressure of scale. Even if it doesn’t work, you’ll learn more and more quickly from failing to roll out the easy stuff than failing to roll out the hard stuff. Over time you will move towards comprehensive approaches.</p>
<p>Just a company&rsquo;s technical quality bar will shift over time, the approach to managing technical quality must evolve in tandem. Here is a iterative approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start small:
<ul>
<li>Fix the problem spots that are causing immediate problems.</li>
<li>Define errors out of existence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Baselines:
<ul>
<li>Understand what best practices exist.</li>
<li>Measure technical quality to guide deeper investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prioritize:
<ul>
<li>Identify leverage points that help.</li>
<li>Use your baselines to guide efforts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scale:
<ul>
<li>Spin up a teams where the mandate it to create systems and tools that help scale the efforts.</li>
<li>Run a quality programs that apply the systems and tools more generally.</li>
</ul>
