Doing things outdoors is a huge part of my life. There are a number of common
adages people use in the outdoor community that resonate with even off the
trail. For example, two of my favorites are <i><b> there are no shortcuts to any
place worth going </b></i> or <i><b> leave it better than you found it </b></i>.

The latter of the two consistently finds its way into my head. Both on the
trail, and at work in whatever code base I'm in that week. Obviously, everywhere
we look we will see room for improvement - I'm not saying to overhaul anything
but rather to make the small incremental changes that can improve the experience
even a little.

Most of the time you aren't explicitly on the trail to remove trash, just like
in a code base your work usually isn't explicitly to clean up what is there.
Picking up that small piece of trash on the trail might go largely unnoticed;
but you can be comforted that by picking it up, it won't bum any one else out.
Fixing up a file - adding verbose comments, type hints, or removing unused code -
while you are in there making additions might go unnoticed as well but at the
very least the next time someone is in there they might not have to deal with
the thing you did. And if everyone is pitching in we might not have trash on our
trails..

Clearly there are going to be some conflicting thoughts that go along with
this... <i><b> I should only change what I'm trying to do in the PR </b></i> - and I do
agree with that, but personally I think it's totally worth it to lump some
cleaning in with regular work. You don't need to touch all the files.. but hey,
if your in there clean it up; leave it better than you found it.
