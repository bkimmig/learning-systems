[Tyler Cowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Cowen) is an economics professor at [George Mason University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason_University). He runs the [Mercatus Center](https://www.mercatus.org/), which bridges the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems. He’s published a [blog](https://marginalrevolution.com) (which you should subscribe to if you haven't already) and publishes a [podcast](https://conversationswithtyler.com/) among other things.

Tyler ends every episode of his podcast asking about other people’s production function. How do you get so much done? What’s the secret sauce of all that you’ve accomplished? This episode is entirely devoted to that question.
