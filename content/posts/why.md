![Learning Systems](/resources/why/conveyor-belt.png)

Accelerating to a future where we can build better experiences, create more output or solve harder problems is only possible with better systems. These systems will allow us to better leverage available inputs. These systems will also help us amplify exising knowledge and shed light on where more effort is required.

As volumes increase, the complexity of products improves, the overall system becomes more of a product that the output itself. As the system that builds the systems, our factories are so important that we believe they will ultimately deserve an order of magnitude more attention in engineering than what they produce.

Today, there is a lot of material on how to write code (the final product), but there's much less about how to build these factories. This stuff is complicated and hard to get right. But it matters.

This living document that will get updated on our learning as we go about building these factories. By following along you'll get a first hand view at how the sausage is made. Hopefully, this will help you build better learning systems or we can all improve the way we think.
