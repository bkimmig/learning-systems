Accelerating to a future where we can do more is only possible with better systems. These systems should allow us to better leverage available inputs, solve harder problems or provide guidance where necessary.

As the complexity of the output increases, the overall system becomes more of a product that the output itself. These systems are so important that we believe they will ultimately deserve an order of magnitude more attention in engineering than what they produce.

Today there is a some guidance and expertise on how to create the final product (ex. how to write code), but there's much less about how to build these systems. This stuff is complicated and hard to get right. But it matters.

“We are as Gods and might as well get good at it” [Stewart Brand](https://www.weareasgods.film/) wrote in 1968. A legendary pioneer urges people to use their god-like powers to push the envelop. He created the [Whole Earth Catlog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog) to provider other with "access to tools".
