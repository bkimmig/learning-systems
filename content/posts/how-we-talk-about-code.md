A while back I had a boss that had very strong opinions about how the team
talked about our code base. His general attitude was roughly this "once the code
is in the main branch, it is now <i>our</i> code and no longer <i>my</i> code".
Basically the thought was this; as a team we've agreed, by review, that we
accept this code and are saying this can go in our shared code base - now making
it <i>our</i> code that we are all responsible for.

In general this is a pretty small thing to note, but I do think the way we talk
about things can have a huge impact on the way we interact with them. When viewing
something as the team's we might all take more care using/improving it. This
shared responsibility also helps around blame - which should really be avoided
in general.. something broke, big deal (and it might be), the why is <i>much</i>
more important than the <i>who</i>.

As a team we should support and help one another as much as possible. I believe
this a very small thing that, overtime, can improve the way we work together and
help improve things through a feeling of shared responsibility.

** I should really due diligence and search around for where this "our/my" idea
 originated. If it was my boss, I'll make sure to give explicit credit.
